Did my very first podcast with a group of friends. You can read more and comment about it at the [techno-cast](http://techno-cast.blogspot.com/2009/05/podcast-0-aka-hello-world-google-wave.html) site.

\[ [Download podcast MP3](http://dl.getdropbox.com/u/1240675/TechnoBabble%20Podcast%200%20-%20Hello%20%28Google%29%20Wave.mp3) \]

Quote from techno-cast site:

> Is it a brave new step to boldly go where no web giant has gone before, or merely a mashup of pre-existing tools? An attempt to capture some enterprise market share or to fundamentally change the way the Internet works? Will we see massive gains in worker productivity or the advent of real-time spam from Nigeria? We discuss!

Hope you like it. Do drop in your comments.
