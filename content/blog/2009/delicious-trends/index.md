In my [first post](https://hitesh.in/2009/hello-world/), I talked about analysing my interests based on delicious bookmarks. This post is to announce that I have cleaned up the script a bit and posted it on this blog. [Try it out.](https://hitesh.in/delicious-trends/ "Delicious Trends")

> #### What is delicious trends?
> 
> It is a simple visualisation of your online taste. All your bookmarks will be plotted on a time line, helping you to see how your interests evolved over time.
> 
> **Note:** All processing is done in your browser and no data is sent to my server.
> 
> #### Why did I create it?
> 
> Once upon a time, not too long ago, I was wondering what interested me. After a while of introspection, I got a lot of answers from my heart, but my mind wanted a quantitative proof. So I decided to look at my bookmarks to find what I bookmarked and when.
> 
> #### How was it created?
> 
> A quick (& dirty) mashup of delicious api + jquery + google visualisation plugin. Most of the code is straight out of the samples. My desire was to find the answers I was looking for, ASAP.
