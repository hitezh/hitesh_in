EveryÂ [micro ISV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_ISV "Micro ISV") needs several standard things to get started. Few of them are:

- A web host
- A web site, including a blog
- A store front
- Email
- Customer support infrastructure like forums, CRM, Chat, etc.
- Bug tracker
- Source Control
- Build environment

Apart from these, some software related bits

- Common controls / Custom controls
- Framework things like:
- Installer
- Auto updater

And if your software is not open source, then

- Obfuscater
- Software copy protection
- Licensing
- Payment provider

And some marketing related:

- Software submitter
- Ad network

What I could come up with so far are:

- [Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/ "Trac"): Issue Tracker
- [VersionOne](http://www.versionone.com/ "VersionOne"): Hosted Agile Project Management
- [GetSatisfaction](http://getsatisfaction.com/ "GetSatisfaction") / [UserVoice](http://www.uservoice.com): Forums
- [DreamHost](http://www.dreamhost.com/) / Google App Engine / Amazon: Hosting
- [Google Apps](http://www.google.com/a): email and collaboration
- [PayPal](http://www.paypal.com/) / [FastSpring](http://www.fastspring.com/)

I would update the list as and when I find more resources.

Is anything available integrated out-of-the box for a micro ISV to jump start, drop a comment below.
