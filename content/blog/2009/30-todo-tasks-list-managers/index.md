There are a large number of list / task managers that it needs a list for itself. Seems like every one wants to create a task manager, and who could blame them? The only reason I looked up all these task managers is because I had an itch to write one myself.

If there is any correction to be made, please leave a comment. I have deliberately left out comparing or reviewing them since it might be like comparing oranges to lemons :)
