Update: Paul reached out and clarified the problem. 
So the rest of the post is not relevant any more. 

Did not want to post a rant, especially when I haven't yet crystallized my thoughts.

Background: My previous post was about a project I came across - [hornget](https://hitesh.in/2009/opensource-dotnet-projects/). I wanted to help because I liked their ideas. I offered to manage the [SupportedPackages](http://code.google.com/p/hornget/wiki/SupportedPackages) page for them by automating the process. Or to share the script for the same.

Reason for rant: Guess what was the reply?

Nothing at all. The powers that be, simply banned me from the [hornget-dev](http://groups.google.com/group/horn-development) group. I am flabbergasted. I am not sure what brought out this behavior.

If anyone from hornget dev team reads this, could you please spare a minute to explain why is a volunteer treated like this?
