I recently stumbled across [Hornget](http://code.google.com/p/hornget/), which plans to be the maven of .NET world. I found their design philosophy interesting, but haven't yet got a chance to evaluate the project itself.

But what I liked is they have cherry picked very good .NET software building blocks. Here is a list of projects supported by hornget. Even if you do not end up using hornget, this can still act as a good reference.
