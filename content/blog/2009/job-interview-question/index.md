![Job interview in progress](images/072509_0715_Onequestion12.png "Job interview in progress")

Recently, while interviewing a person, I came up with an interesting question. That led to a series of discoveries about the interviewee. So I thought I would share it here.

### How does xUnit work? \*\*

This one question offered insight into various aspects that I cared about. I steered the discussion until I got the answers to these question, without asking them explicitly.

- Do you know what unit testing is? _\- Awareness level_
- When do you write test cases? Before or after the change? _\- Practitioner skills_
- How does unit testing work? _\- Conceptual skills_
- Do you understand annotations? How are they used in JUnit / NUnit? _\- Advanced developer skills_
- Do you understand the implementation behind unit test frameworks, or are you a dumb consumer? _\- Architectural skills_
- How was the implementation explained? _\- Communication skills_

What are your favourite questions?

\*\* Replace xUnit with language specific implementation (JUnit, NUnit, etc.).
