This is what my daughter has to say about my home computers:

> Papa, ever since you made the computer a laptop, it misbehaves and crashes. Please make it a computer again!

Read computer = Ubuntu and laptop = Windows. My desktop ran Ubuntu for a long time until I installed Win7 on it. My laptop always had WinXP as shipped by the manufacturer. My daughter prefers Ubuntu to Windows, looks like I am raising a Linux fangirl :)

I wonder if [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) will publish this on [http://www.overheardathome.com](http://www.overheardathome.com)
