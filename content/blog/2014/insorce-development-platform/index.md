INSORCE is built on a combination of technologies that are considered safe by bank's for their data center, yet cutting edge to deliver performance that is superior to a desktop application.

We are building on Microsoft stack for 2 reasons

1. Banks find it easy to deploy and manage
2. Availability of competent professionals

The key parts of INSORCE are:

> - [ASP.Net MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc), where the views are mostly returning JSON results.
> - SQL Server, old war horse, banks can easily manage.
> - [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/), the browser side MVVM framework. This is what makes the app's performance stand out.
> - [Lucene.Net](http://lucenenet.apache.org/) for search
> - [SignalR](http://www.asp.net/signalr) for push notifications

Apart from this, it is a mix of:

> - [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) & custom styling for UI
> - [JQPlot](http://www.jqplot.com/) and [d3.js](http://d3js.org/) for charts
> - [Telerik Silverlight Diagram](http://www.telerik.com/products/silverlight/diagrams.aspx) and [KineticJS](http://kineticjs.com/) for graphs
> - [Teamcity](http://www.jetbrains.com/teamcity/) for continuous integration
> - Few others like miniprofiler, bvalidator, magic-suggest, datatables round off the libraries used.

I would go into some of the above in detail in future posts.
