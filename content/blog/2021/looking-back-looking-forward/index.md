One more revolution completed, amid the pandemic. Yet, it was an eventful year with lots of good memories, a new workplace, and a new set of friends.  
As I look back at a good life, I would probably do a few things differently, if given a do-over.

## Attend college

Actually attend college, instead of just writing exams. Have fun and make lifelong friends. While I am at college, maybe study engineering too.

## Stay in Hyderabad

Instead of having a whimsical decision to move to Chennai for a job after post-graduation, I would stay in Hyderabad if given the same choice.

## Continue Parixa

I would have stuck out longer with my first startup, giving it a real chance of success. I will hustle more, instead of folding it after 18 months.

## Shorter stay in Frankfurt

Instead of spending 7 years in Frankfurt, I would return earlier. Maybe have our first child after returning, rather than before going to Frankfurt. _My wife disagrees with this entirely._

## Better Financial Planning

Earlier years were ad-hoc and reactionary. Although I corrected it later, I would sure start early.

  
Although I cannot change the past, here are a few things I would like to do in the future.

- Start a company, grow a company
- Write a book, maybe a few books
- Sketch
- Farm
- Travel the country
