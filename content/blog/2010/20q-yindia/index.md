### Introduction

Q. In your own words, who are you and what is your business?

I am just a young creative mind, who feels that everyone can sell anything; but the only reason why everyone doesn't become a businessman, is that they don't have a product to sell. Since they don't have anything to sell they sell somebody else's product. All one needs is to be creative, a little passionate and definitely risk taking. My business is [](http://www.yindia.co.in)www.yindia.co.in. It is a new and a creative website which give a purpose to networking. It is a place where creative minds will compete and get recognition. It may not be a very big recognition like any reality show that makes you an overnight star but it will make you realise the star potential in you.

Q. How did you come up with the idea for your business?

Well a very less famous person once said that the best of business ideas come from ones own need. If you really want to start a business then just think is there anything that you want or ever wanted that you couldn't get because of unavailability and that's where you create a product. My business idea comes from my own life. As a young guy I have many creative interests and dream, but I never could pursue them. May be because of lack of knowledge and may be 'coz I never knew how good I am outside the boundary walls of my school and college. So I thought of giving the young generation something I did not get. It's less of a business idea and more of an initiative. By the way that less famous person is nobody else but me.

Q. Is this your first business?

Well definitely yes, it's my first business. I would prefer to call it an initiative than business. It's my way of changing the systems and things that are currently there in India.

### Market

Q. Who are your customers?

My customers are the young creative minds who have dreams, who don't want to follow the rat race. We all are following a rat race due to which we couldn't follow our heart and dream careers for which we blame our society, our parents but the reason why we could follow is that we never tried because of lack of self belief. One needs to go through a competitive environment to get this self assessment and self belief.What I never appreciated in my life is the follower approach. Because following curbs creativity This site is for those young minds that have that creativity to do things differently. They can try and test out there skills. Have you ever thought the reports and presentations we have made in our college life how good they are? Its not always about marks.

You are all alone when you do something. So everything you do, you have to do all alone. Don't expect anything from anyone. You have to have confidence in yourself. Don't do it just 'coz you don't want to do anything else but do it coz you want to do it.
