#### The blog is now one year old, _woo hoo_!

When I started the blog, I was not sure if I could sustain it. But here I am, 1 yr and 49 posts later. Although I could not post once a week as I promised myself, I was close enough.

If only I could share statistics to prove how popular this blog is, but both of you know it isn't :)

So, here's looking forward to another year of blogging, and hope to see you soon with a non-self-congratulatory post.

PS. The break in blogging was a result of a nice long vacation in May.
